# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<a href="https://transporter-7792b.web.app/" target="_blank">Live site</a>
Its a dummy transporting service website where you can select vehicles and see tickets kind of thing. 
It has firebase authentication system. Google sign in and regular email password sign up and in. 
I tried to show a map but that didn't work. 

I used 98% bootstrap for the structure and design of this site.
